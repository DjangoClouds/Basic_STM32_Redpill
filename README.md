# Basic STM32 Redpill Based Board

KiCAD PCB Design based on the STM32 Bluepill. Done with guidance from Phil's Lab STM32 PCB Design Tutorial from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVUqaB0IMh4).
This version has been adjusted to incorporate a Raspberry Pi compatable header, two stepper motor drivers and a larger STM32 IC. It is, obviously, somewhat larger.
